# Assigment
### Problem Set 0
```python
x = input("Enter a number x : ")
y = input("Enter a number y : ")

print("x**y =",int(x)**int(y))
print("log(x) =",int(x).bit_length()-1)
```

### Problem Set 1
```python
# Part A: House Hunting
annual_salary = float(input("Enter you annual salary: "))
portion_saved = float(
  input("Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: "))
total_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of your dream home: "))

portion_down_payment = 0.25 * total_cost
current_savings = 0
r = 0.04
monthly_salary = annual_salary / 12
portion_saved = portion_saved * monthly_salary
count = 0

while (current_savings < portion_down_payment):
  count += 1
  current_savings += (current_savings * r) / 12 + portion_saved

print("Number of months: ", count)
```
<br>

```python
# Part B: Saving, with a raise
annual_salary = float(input("Enter your starting annual salary: "))
portion_saved = float(
    input("Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: "))
total_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of your dream home: "))
semi_annual_raise = float(input("Enter the semi-annual raise, as a decimal: "))

portion_down_payment = 0.25 * total_cost
current_savings = 0.0
monthly_saved = (annual_salary / 12) * portion_saved

r = 0.04
count = 0

while (current_savings < portion_down_payment):
    count += 1
    monthly_return = current_savings * r / 12
    current_savings += monthly_return + monthly_saved

    if (count % 6 == 0):
        annual_salary += annual_salary * semi_annual_raise
        monthly_saved = (annual_salary / 12) * portion_saved

print("Number of months: ", count)

```
