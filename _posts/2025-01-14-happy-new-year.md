I started programming because I love the certainty.
I had no doubt while studying language. (you know like if-else, for loop, while loop etc...)
BUT since I start developing, I realized that computer is so unpredictable like 5 years old kid.
Mostly, I was responsible for itðŸ˜…


When studying alone, I feel stuck, lost and get stressed sometimes.
I know it's natural and I should get over it.
I'm just trying to better than yesterday and do my best.
I will be a happy programmer this year.
